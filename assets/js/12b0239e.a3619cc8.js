A linked list node's value and next node are typically stored in value and next properties, respectively.\n    \n    The first node in a linked list is referred to as the **head** of the linked list, while the last node in a linked list, whose next property points to the null value, is known as the **tail** of the linked list.\n    \n    Below is a visual representation of a singly linked list whose nodes hold integer values:\n    \n    0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> null\n    \n    A singly linked list typically exposes its head to its user for easy access. While finding a node in a singly linked list involves traversing through all of the nodes leading up to the node in question (as opposed to instant access with an array), adding or removing nodes simply involves overwriting next pointers (assuming that you have access to the node right before the node that you're adding or removing).\n    \n    The following are a singly linked list's standard operations and their corresponding time complexities:\n    \n    *   **Accessing the head**: O(1)\n    *   **Accessing the tail**: O(n)\n    *   **Accessing a middle node**: O(n)\n    *   **Inserting / Removing the head**: O(1)\n    *   **Inserting / Removing the tail**: O(n) to access + O(1)\n    *   **Inserting / Removing a middle node**: O(n) to access + O(1)\n    *   **Searching for a value**: O(n)\n    \n*   #### Space Complexity\n    \n    A measure of how much auxiliary memory an algorithm takes up, space complexity is a central concept in the field of algorithms and in coding interviews.\n    \n    It's expressed using **Big O** notation.\n    \n*   #### Stack\n    \n    An array-like data structure whose elements follow the **LIFO** rule: **L**ast **I**n, **F**irst **O**ut.\n    \n    A stack is often compared to a stack of books on a table: the last book that's placed on the stack of books is the first one that's taken off the stack.\n    \n    The following are a stack's standard operations and their corresponding time complexities:\n    \n    *   **Pushing an element onto the stack**: O(1)\n    *   **Popping an element off the stack**: O(1)\n    *   **Peeking at the element on the top of the stack**: O(1)\n    *   **Searching for an element in the stack**: O(n)\n    \n    A stack is typically implemented with a **dynamic array** or with a **singly linked list**.\n    \n*   #### String\n    \n    One of the fundamental data types in Computer Science, strings are stored in **memory** as **arrays** of integers, where each character in a given string is mapped to an integer via some character-encoding standard like **ASCII**.\n    \n    Strings behave much like normal arrays, with the main distinction being that, in most programming languages (C++ is a notable exception), strings are **immutable**, meaning that they can't be edited after creation. This also means that simple operations like appending a character to a string are more expensive than they might appear.\n    \n    The canonical example of an operation that's deceptively expensive due to string immutability is the following:\n    \n    string = \"this is a string\"\n    newString = \"\"\n    \n    for character in string:\n        newString += character\n    \n    The operation above has a time complexity of **O(n2)** where n is the length of string, because each addition of a character to newString creates an entirely new string and is itself an **O(n)** operation. Therefore, n O(n) operations are performed, leading to an O(n2) time-complexity operation overall.\n    \n*   #### Time Complexity\n    \n    A measure of how fast an algorithm runs, time complexity is a central concept in the field of algorithms and in coding interviews.\n    \n    It's expressed using **Big O** notation.\n    \n*   #### Tree\n    \n    A data structure that consists of nodes, each with some value and pointers to child-nodes, which recursively form **subtrees** in the tree.\n    \n    The first node in a tree is referred to as the **root** of the tree, while the nodes at the bottom of a tree (the nodes with no child-nodes) are referred to as **leaf nodes** or simply **leaves**. The paths between the root of a tree and its leaves are called **branches**, and the **height** of a tree is the length of its longest branch. The **depth** of a tree node is its distance from its tree's root; this is also known as the node's **level** in the tree.\n    \n    A tree is effectively a **graph** that's **connected**, **directed**, and **acyclic**, that has an explicit root node, and whose nodes all have a single **parent** (except for the root node, which effectively has no parent). Note that in most implementations of trees, tree nodes don't have a pointer to their parent, but they can if desired.\n    \n    There are many types of trees and tree-like structures, including **binary trees**, **heaps**, and **tries**.\n    \n*   #### Undirected Graph\n    \n    A **graph** whose **edges** are undirected, meaning that they can be traversed in both directions.\n    \n    For example, a graph of friends would likely be undirected, since a friendship is, by nature, bidirectional.\n")))}c.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
