# Complexity Analysis

## Key Terms

### Complexity Analysis

The process of determining now efficient an algorithm is. Complexity analysis usually involves finding both the **time and space complexity** of an algorithm.

Complexity analusis is effectively used to determine how "good" an algorithm is and whether it's "better" than another one.

### Time Complexity
A measuer of how fast an algorithm runs, time complexity is central concept in the field of alogrithms and is coding interviews. 
It's expressed using **Big O** notation.

### Space Complexity 
A measure of how much auxiliary memomry an algorithm takes up, space complexity is a central concept in the field of algorithms and in coding interview.
It's expressed using **Big O** notation.
