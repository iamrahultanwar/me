# Introduction

This is the official documentation website for the **Hydyco framework**. We have divided the documentation into multiple groups, each trying to address a specific use case or audience.

## Why Hydyco ?

Idea behind Hydyco is just to speed up the process of creating apis. Entrepreneurs can focus more on there ideas , instead of doing same stuff again.

## Create new app

Create Hydyco app by using hydyco cli

```shell

```

## Start your app

```
